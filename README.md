# jiu-jitsu-guard
The jiu jitsu guard is a BJJ position with tons of various types. And this depends on the points of control (grips) that you install.  For example, there are the Brazilian ju jitsu closed guard, open guard, spider guard, half guard, butterfly guard just to name a few.  Furthermore, some jiu-jitsu guard positions are perfect when your opponent standing and other guards are effective when he or she is kneeling.  Otherwise, some jiujitsu guard attacks are savage with the BJJ gi and others without the gi.   Itâ€™s important to recognize that some jiu-jitsu guards positions are ideal for BJJ grappling submissions but can be dangerous to play at mixed martial  art (MMA) tournaments.And others maybe can serve as a defense or escape from some dominant positions.
